### POPCAST
The POPcast with Dan POP! Join host Dan "Pop" Papandrea as he has conversations with the fascinating people that are driving technology and thought leadership. We cover their personal stories and journeys,including their wins and losses, to deep dive into what it is like to lead through technology and new ways of thinking. The POPCAST is one of the world's first open source podcast where guests and questions are often driven through community contributors.  THE POPCAST Podcast is in no way affiliated with Sysdig (even though he loves his company very much)

# POPCAST's MISSION
The POPCAST's mission is to connect technical and thought leaders with the community and the audience that goes BEYOND JUST CODE.
