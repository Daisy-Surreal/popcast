### POPCAST
The POPcast with Dan POP! Join host Dan “Pop” Papandrea as he has conversations with the fascinating people that are driving technology and thought leadership. We cover their personal stories and their journeys including their wins and losses to deep dive into what it is like to lead through technology and new ways of thinking. The POPCAST is one of the world's first open source podcast where some guests and questions are driven through community contributors.

# POPCAST's MISSION
The POPCAST's mission is to connect technical and thought leaders with the community and the audience that goes BEYOND JUST CODE.
